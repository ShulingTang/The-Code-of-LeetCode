### question

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

#### Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

#### Example 1:

Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3

#### Example 2:

Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99

### Solution
```
# 位运算，还需要回顾
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for i in range(32):
            cnt = 0  # 记录当前 bit 有多少个1
            bit = 1 << i  # 记录当前要操作的 bit
            for num in nums:
                if num & bit != 0:
                    cnt += 1
            if cnt % 3 != 0:
                # 不等于0说明唯一出现的数字在这个 bit 上是1
                res |= bit

        return res - 2 ** 32 if res > 2 ** 31 - 1 else res
```
