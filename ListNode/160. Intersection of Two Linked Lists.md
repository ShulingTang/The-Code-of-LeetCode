## [160.Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)
### lable: ListNode
### Question

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.
#### Example 1:
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). 

From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
#### Example 2:
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
#### Example 3:
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: null
Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
### Notes
 - If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null. 
 - The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
 - You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
 - Each value on each linked list is in the range [1, 10^9].
 - Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.
 
 ## Answer
 
 ### 1、[Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/solution/intersection-of-two-linked-lists-shuang-zhi-zhen-l/)
 #### Method
 - 我们通常做这种题的思路是设定两个指针分别指向两个链表头部，一起向前走直到其中一个到达末端，另一个与末端距离则是两链表的 长度差。再通过长链表指针先走的方式消除长度差，最终两链表即可同时走到相交点。

 - 换个方式消除长度差： 拼接两链表。设长-短链表为 C，短-长链表为 D （分别代表长链表在前和短链表在前的拼接链表），则当 C 走到长短链表交接处时，D 走在长链表中，且与长链表头距离为 长度差;
#### Code
```
class Solution(object):
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA, headB):
        ha, hb = headA, headB
        while ha != hb:
            ha = ha.next if ha else headB
            hb = hb.next if hb else headA
        return ha
```

### 2、 [先走差值](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/solution/luo-ji-chao-ji-qing-chu-de-pythonjie-ti-dai-ma-by-/)

#### Method

先计算两个链表的长度，然后用两个节点长节点和段节点，然后循环让节点先走两个链表之差的距离，之后长短链表再同时向后遍历，直到找到相同节点。

#### Code
```
class Solution:
    def getLength(selt, head: ListNode) -> int:
        length = 0
        while head:
            length += 1
            head = head.next
        return length


    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        len_a = self.getLength(headA)
        len_b = self.getLength(headB)

        long_head = headA
        short_head = headB
        diff = len_a - len_b
        if len_b > len_a:
            long_head = headB
            short_head = headA
            diff = len_b - len_a

        while diff > 0:
            long_head = long_head.next
            diff -= 1

        while long_head and short_head:
            if long_head is short_head:
                return long_head
            long_head = long_head.next
            short_head = short_head.next

        return long_head
```
